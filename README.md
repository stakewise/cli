# Operator CLI

Operators CLI is responsible for generating the validators keys,
deposit data required to register them and uploading the keys to the Hashicorp Vault.

## Usage

### Step 1. Installation

See [releases page](https://github.com/stakewise/cli/releases) to download and decompress the corresponding binary files.

### Step 2. Generate DAO proposal

Run the following command to generate DAO proposal:

```bash
./operator-cli generate-proposal
```

**NB! You must store the generated mnemonic in a secure cold storage.
It will allow you to restore the keys in case the Vault will get corrupted or lost.**

### Step 3. Submit DAO proposal

Create a post about joining operators set at [StakeWise Forum](https://vote.stakewise.io).
In your post you must include the `Specification` section that was generated in step 2.

### Step 4. Deploy ETH2 infrastructure

If the proposal from step 3 is approved by the DAO, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/stakewise/helm-charts/tree/main/operator#readme)
to deploy the ETH2 staking infrastructure.

### Step 5. Sync keys to the Vault

You must **use the same mnemonic** as generated in step 1.
Also, **using the same mnemonic for multiple vaults will result into validator slashing**.

Run the following command to sync new validator keys to the vault:

```bash
./operator-cli sync-vault
```

After uploading the keys, restart the validators that got new keys added.

### Step 6. Commit Operator

Once you're 100% ready for ether assignments to the validators, commit your operator:

- Go to the [Operators smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/<address>#writeProxyContract)
- Click on `Connect to Web3` button and connect your wallet. The address must match the one used during proposal generation.
- Call `commitOperator` function. If that's your onboarding, you must deposit 1 ETH collateral together with the call.

Congratulations on becoming StakeWise Node OperatorðŸŽ‰.
Your validators will get ether assigned, and you can claim your operator rewards from [Farms Page](https://app.stakewise.io/farms).
