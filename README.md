# Operator CLI

Operators CLI generates validators keys and deposit data for the validators.
The validator keys have to be uploaded to the Hashicorp Vault or fetched locally.
Read more about [operators onboarding process](https://docs.stakewise.io/node-operator/onboarding-process)

## Usage

### Step 1. Installation

See [releases page](https://github.com/stakewise/cli/releases) to download and decompress the corresponding binary files.

### Step 2. Create Deposit Data

Run the following command to create deposit data and DAO proposal specification:

```bash
./operator-cli create-deposit-data
```

**NB! You must store the generated mnemonic in a secure cold storage.
It will allow you to restore the keys in case the Vault will get corrupted or lost.**

### Step 3. Submit DAO proposal

Create a post about joining operators set at [StakeWise Forum](https://vote.stakewise.io).
In your post you must include the `Specification` section that was generated in the previous step.

### Step 4. Deploy ETH2 infrastructure

If the proposal from the previous step got approved by the DAO, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/node-operator/stakewise-infra-package/usage)
to deploy the ETH2 staking infrastructure.

### Step 5. Sync keys to the Vault or locally

You must **use the same mnemonic** as generated in step 1.
**NB! Using the same mnemonic for multiple vaults will result into validators slashings**.

Run the following command to sync new validator keys to the vault:

```bash
./operator-cli sync-vault
```

or to sync them locally

```bash
./operator-cli sync-local
```

After fetching the keys, make sure you have the right number of validators running and restart those that got new keys added.

### Step 6. Commit Operator

Once you're 100% ready for Ether assignments, commit your operator:

- Go to the Operators smart contract ([Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x0d92156861a0BC7037cC21470327Bd3Bc750EB1D#writeProxyContract), [Harbour Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x7C27896338e3130036E53BCC0f013cB20e21991c#writeProxyContract), [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x002932e11E95DC84C17ed5f94a0439645D8a97BC), [Harbour Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x270ad793b7bb315a9fd07f1fffd8ab1e3621df7e))
- Click on `Connect to Web3` button and connect your wallet. The address must match the one used during proposal generation.
- Call `commitOperator` function. If that's your onboarding, you must deposit 1 ETH (specified in Wei) collateral together with the call.

Congratulations on becoming StakeWise Node OperatorðŸŽ‰.
Your validators will get ether assigned, and you can claim your operator rewards from [Farms Page](https://app.stakewise.io/farms).
